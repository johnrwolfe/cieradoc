== 11969 Message Class Generation

=== 1 Abstract

When connecting an xtUML-generated application to a browser-based client it is often necessary to 
produce a Java class for each interface message passed between the application and a client.
This feature enables a user to specify, via marking, interface messages for which a Java class must
be generated.  

=== 2 Introduction and Background

Some web frameworks, such as Spring, require a Java class for each message.  The Spring framework 
requires each message class to define 'get' and 'set' methods for each attribute.  Manually writing
such classes is tedious and error-prone, so this feature automates the process.

Refer to the hand-coded message classes within the 
https://github.com/johnrwolfe/CarPark/tree/master/Deployment/src/main/java/deployment[CarPark Deployment project] 
for examples.

Note: the requirements, below, are specific to the Spring framework. Other frameworks may differ in 
name formatting, constructor parameters, etc.  The marking, however, may be applied independently of 
Spring framework use.

=== 3 Requirements

. A mark specifies for which messages a Java class must be generated.
. Each generated message class includes a `messageName` data member of type String.
. Each message parameter is represented by a corresponding data member of type String.
. Each data member name is formatted as `camelCase` with a lowercase initial letter.
. A 'get' accessor is generated for each data member.
. A 'set' accessor is generated for each data member.
. Each 'get'/'set' accessor name is formatted as `camelCase` with a lowercase initial letter.
For example, the accessor names for a data member named `ticketNumber` are:
** `getTicketNumber`
** `setTicketNumber` 

=== 4 Analysis

Marking is applied on a port boundary, and a class is generated for each
message of the interface with which the port is formalized.  

For each such interface, a package is created as a peer to the generated Java interface 
representing the xtUML interface.  Message classes for the marked interface are placed 
within this package, preventing collisions between identically named message classes 
generated from different xtUML interface definitions which happen to contain identically
named messages.  

=== 5 Design

* Add a mark named `GenerateMessageClasses` to be applied to a port instance identified by path.

* Develop templates for generation of a Java class corresponding to a message.
* At Interface render ( `Iface.render()` ), when marked: for each related (R419) message apply the templates to emit a Java class file.
* Use the Interface file path and package name as basis for emitting to a child package of the interface package.
