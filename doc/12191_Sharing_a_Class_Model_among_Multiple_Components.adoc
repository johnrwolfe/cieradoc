== Sharing a Class Model among Multiple Components 

=== 1 Abstract

Ciera does not support sharing a class model among multiple components within the same application.  
An approach for adding this capability is described below.

=== 2 Introduction and Background

Refer to <<dr-1>> for background.

=== 3 Requirements
==== 3.1 Support Compilation of Applications Using Shared Class Models

Enable successful compilation of an application containing two or more components 
referring to at least one common class model via package reference.  Throughout this
section the term "shared" refers to model elements defined within a package referred 
to by two or more components.  Supported aspects for a component referring to a shared
class model via package reference include:

. Import a shared class and establish an association between it and a class defined within the component
. Import shared classes and establish associations between them
. Establish and remove a link across any association described above
. Create and delete instances of shared classes
. Read and write attributes of instances of shared classes, including derived attributes.
. Invoke class-based and instance-based operations of shared classes, including deferred operations.
. Invoke functions defined in shared packages.
. Invoke bridge operations defined in an external entity defined in a shared package.
. Use enumerations and user-defined types declarwed in a shared package.
. Generate an event to an instance of a shared class
. Receive an event from an instance of a shared class (via pre-created
event instance provided to the instance of a shared class as an event
or operation parameter or an attribute value)

=== 4 Analysis

Fundamental to the Ciera architecture (as of 2.4.0) is the assumption that each class
is defined in precisely one component.  Adding the capability to share a class model
among multiple components invalidates this assumption, requiring significant adjustments to 
the architecture model, the transformations that populate it, and the rendering operations
and templates that rely on it. 

=== 5 Design

==== 5.1 Add ClassInComponent, RelationshipInComponent, and InvocableInComponent

The existing Ciera architecture assumes that each instance of Class, 
Relationship, and InvocableObject is specific to a single component.  Supporting shared class models
invalidates this assumption, so the architecture class models must be adjusted accordingly.

Change the multiplicity of R408 and R448 to many-to-many, adding
associative classes ClassInComponent and RelationshipInComponent 
to represent component-specific application classes and associations.
Add a new many-to-many association between InvocableObject and 
ComponentDefinition and a new associative class, InvocableInComponent,
related to CodeBlock across R4000 which remains otherwise unchanged.

As associations may appear in the context of multiple components, the selector structure which supports 
implementation must change. Selectors become component-specific: Instance Selectors relate to ClassInComponent; 
Set Selectors relate to ClassSet, which is now a set of ClassInComponent instances.

The multiplicity of R409 remains unchanged, and the existing Class
class then represents the component-independent application class
while the the Relationship class represents component-independent 
associations.

Since Class and Relationship are no longer component-specific, the referential attributes 
formalizing associations between ComponentDefinition and these classes are removed from
their identifiers, which has a ripple effect on all classes formalizing associations 
with Class and Relationship using the identifiers for these two classes.

The terminology here may be a bit confusing.  Since the primary use case envisioned 
is one of multiple components within the same model-compilation unit sharing one or 
more class models defined outside _any_ component, we use "component-independent"
to refer to generated artifacts that are independent of the components referring to 
the shared class model.  However, it is possible that a shared class model is defined
within a component which contains nested components referring to that shared class model.
In this case, the generated "component-independent" artifacts are actually specific to 
the containing component, but independent of the contained, referring components.

For a shared class defined outside the component in which it is used, the component-independent 
interface is rendered from from Class.  The component-specific interface and implementation are
rendered from ClassInComponent.  For a class defined within the component in which it is used, the generated code is
is unchanged relative to that produced by the existing compiler.  

Only classes defined outside the component in which they are used require a component-independent interface.  In this 
case the component-specific interface extends the component-independent interface. The component-independent
interface declares no methods and acts only as a common ancestor for all component-specific renditions of the class. 
The package hierarchy in which the relevant modeled class is defined is replicated under the root package, 
and the component-independent interface resides within the resulting package hierarchy, outside the component-specific
packages in which the shared class is used.

==== 5.2 Associate StateMachine with ClassInComponent Instead of Class

Since an instance of StateMachine is created for each component that
refers to a particular modeled class, StateMachine must be associated
with ClassInComponent instead of Class across R4750.

==== 5.3 Associate ClassSet with ClassInComponent Instead of Class

Each instance of ClassSet contains a set of component-specific class instances, 
so it is associated with ClassInComponent instead of Class.

==== 5.4 Use InvocableInComponent for Transforming OAL Bodies

Since each instance of CodeBlock is component-specific, this class is associated with
InvocableInComponent across R4000.  Transforming OAL bodies is accomplished by iterating 
over all instances of InvocableInComponent.  The association between CodeBlock and InvocableInComponent 
enables statements that require knowledge of the component in which they 
reside (e.g., relate and unrelate) to find the appropriate instance of ComponentDefinition.

==== 5.5 Extend Type System

The type system is modified to support references to and resolution of component-independent class types 
as well as component-specific class types and class set types.  

A new subtype of Type, ComponentSpecificType, is added, with ComponentInClass and ClassSet as subtypes.
Two new associations are added to the type class model, one indicating the defining component for a 
component-specific type and another indicating the referring component for each unresolved type.

Most existing callers requesting a type reference remain unchanged except for the need to pass the instance of 
ComponentDefinition within which the reference is being added.  For the cases in which a reference to a 
component-independent class type is required, a new operation is provided.  

Type::Resolve() is invoked to resolve built-in, enumerated, and user-defined types while 
ComponentSpecificType::resolve() is used for resolving ClassSet and ClassInComponent types.
A new operation is added to Type for resolving component-independent class types.

As some types may now have component-dependent variants, adding type import directives 
to a file must ensure that the correct variant - if there is one - is selected.
Accordingly, the various subtypes of file are given an optional deferred operation which 
determines whether the file subtype has relevance to the component being processed and it is, 
therefore, appropriate to import the proffered type.

==== 5.6 Support Utilities (EEs) in Shared Packages

A pattern similar to that of Class and ClassInComponent already exists with Utility and UtilityReference,
so it is exploited to support a Utility defined within a shared package which is referred to via package
reference by two or more components.  

Utility and UtilityFunction are treated as component-independent classes with a single instance created
for each EE and bridge operation respectively in the system.  Similar to the approach used for ClassInComponent,
rendering of generated code for each EE in the system is now done by UtilityInComponent::render().  Utility is 
replaced by UtilityInComponent (renamed from UtilityReference) as a subtype of File. UtilityInComponent denotes 
that the definition of a Utility has been encountered in a package within the component. A separate association 
denotes that a component merely invokes one or more Utility operations, which is required for rendering the appropriate 
utility initialization for the component.
 
As part of this work, an OAL body associated with a bridge operation is now translated (ref. <<dr-2>>).

=== 6 Implementation Comments

==== 6.1 Bridge Operations with OAL Activities

At present, Ciera does not translate an OAL activity specified for a bridge operation (ref. <<dr-2>>).
As part of the work involved in this issue necessitated adding InvocableInComponent as a means of supporting component-specific 
versions of defined Utilities, the opportunity was taken to associate a body with the transformed Utility.

=== 7 Acceptance Test

. Initial testing compiles any non-shared class model e.g. CarPark for sanity check.
. A comprehensive test of features using shared packages is available
in the https://github.com/xtuml/models/tree/master/VandMC_testing/VerifierTest/Verify11958[Verify11958 model].
. A final sanity check is to build a new Ciera SNAPSHOT with the modified compiler.
